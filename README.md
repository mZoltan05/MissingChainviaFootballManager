# MissingChainviaFootballManager
This is my final exam project at University.

It is about to find football players by their abilities. 
The project includes a PostgreSQL server, a Python Django Web Application and outer Machine Learning functions writed in Python.
I attached my research in the field of Data Driven Scouting in Football, and the documentation of the solution (HUN).



Short summary:

The aim of my thesis was:

  • to exposit data-driven scouting in football,

  • to store the data of Football Manager in the fitting structure,

  • to create a web application to make the data reachable,

  • to provide data filtering and sorting,

  • to provide machine learning usage to the user to find the adequate players.

A new feature has been added: the opportunity of import new data to keep up to date the player informations.

In addition player ratings and their price development were explained. The presentation of cooperation and solutions of Django, PostgreSQL and external Python programs is an important part of the thesis.

I have also explained why I used this data and what kind of business value can be extrac-ted from it.
